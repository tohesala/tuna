    """
    Implements the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) directly using the
    definition. This is useful for testing, as the algorithm is much simpler to
    understand, and FFT should return the exact same output. This also enables
    verifying the performance characteristics of the fft implementation, as it
    should be much faster for large inputs (O(n lg n) vs O(n^2)).
